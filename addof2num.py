#This program demonstrates the addition of two numbers by taking input from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: ")) #taking first number
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: ")) #taking second number
add = num1 + num2 #addition operation
#now printing the output 
print(f"The Sum of {num1} and {num2} is" add)
