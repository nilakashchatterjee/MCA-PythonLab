# Q2. Write a program to calculate the total cost from shopping for n commodities. The input consists
# of an integer n, followed by n pairs or doubles. In each pair, the first number is the quantity
# bought
# of the commodity, and the second is the rate per unit for the commodity. The amount to be paid for
# each commodity is the product of the quantity and the rate; the program must print the total over
# all commodities. For example, if the input is 3 2 30 3 10 5 60, the expected answer is
# 2*30+3*10+5*60=390
